# E-commerce Database Design

ðŸ“¦ A relational database schema for a modern e-commerce platform â€” built as a group assignment to demonstrate ERD planning, SQL implementation, and structured data modeling.



## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To design and implement a comprehensive e-commerce database using MySQL, incorporating entities like products, variations, categories, brands, images, and attributes. This includes:

- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- SQL schema with 12 interrelated tables
- Structured and scalable relational design



## ERD
The following Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the structure of the e-commerce database. It includes tables for products, variations, categories, brands, images, attributes, and more. All relationships and foreign key dependencies are visualized for clarity and normalization.

Legend:

Primary Keys are underlined.

Foreign Keys are connected with arrows.

All table relationships are normalized to avoid data redundancy.

Tables like color, size_option, and product_attribute handle product variations and custom details.


##  Data Flow Summary

This e-commerce database is designed to model how product data flows from general information to purchasable items:

1. **Products** are stored in the `product` table and linked to a `brand` and `product_category`.
2. Each `product` can have multiple **variations**, which are defined by combinations of `color` and `size_option` in the `product_variation` table.
3. Every unique combination of variation becomes a **purchasable item** (`product_item`) with its own price, SKU, and stock quantity.
4. **Product images** and **attributes** (like material or weight) are linked back to each `product` for richer content.

This structured approach ensures data consistency and scalability across multiple variations, colors, and sizes.

##  SQL Schema Overview

The database includes:
- Products and Categories
- Brands and Images
- Sizes and Colors
- Product Variations and Items (SKU-level)
- Product Attributes (material, weight, etc.)
- Fully normalized structure with referential integrity
